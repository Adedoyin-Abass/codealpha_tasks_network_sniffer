# CodeAlpha_Basic_Network_Sniffer
A project I made as an intern in codealpha

Trying to figure out what kind of network sniffer i wanted to make. I decided to focus on my immediate environment which meant the desktop i was stuck with all day at work.

Tools Used
Vim - Kali Virtual Box

Code
Python. I had to import the socket, struct, and textwrap libraries
